Georges Chi-,ire has been\\r\\n the president of Societe de Recherches et Etudes Parapsycholo-\\r\\n giques, Route de Bordeaux, Toulenne (Gironde), France. The\\r\\n I.A.A. Anstalt directory lists 18 individuals wvith \"special know-\\r\\n ledge\". 39 organizations with either a religious, philosophical or\\r\\n scientific  interest  in  the paranormal, 23  publications and  13\\r\\n researchers.\\r\\n Germany. Dr. Hans Bender, director of the Institut fuer Grenz-\\r\\n gebiete der Psvchologie (Border Areas of Psychology) at Eichhalde\\r\\n 12. Freiburg Br., which is a part of the University of Freiburg,\\r\\n is one of the best-known parapsychologists in Europe. Dr. Fried-\\r\\n bert Kanter, a physicist at the Plasma-Physik Institut at Garching,\\r\\n near Munich, has also done much to interest his scientific collea-\\r\\n aues in investigations involving the paranormal.\\r\\n Historically,  Dr.  A.  Freiherrn  von  Schrenck-Notzing,  Prof.\\r\\n Johann C. F. Zoellner, professor of physics and astronomy, and\\r\\n Dr. Hans Gerloff contributed much from this country to enrich\\r\\n the experiments and investigations of the paranormal. Dr. Werner\\r\\n Schieheler at    the  Ravensburg  Technical  Engineering   School,\\r\\n inherited th  Gerloff collection of books, literature and paranormal\\r\\n artifacts and is carrying on in the tradition, systematically design-\\r\\n ing experiments and equipment to measure and record evidence of\\r\\n paranormality.\\r\\n Others currently involved in one or more aspects of the psychic\\r\\n scene in (.e-many include:\\r\\n Frau Manna Buschbeck, Horb, Co-ordinator of research on\\r\\n taped voices.\\r\\n Dr. Wolfgang Ehrenburg, Psychophysical Society.

People like Zoellner and\\r\\n Schrenck-Notzing received both recognition and ridicule for their\\r\\n efforts in exploring the unusual. During the Hitler period every-\\r\\n thing related to the paranormal which did not fit the goals and\\r\\n ideology v of the Third Reich was suppressed or iiquidated, although\\r\\n Pauwels and Bergier in The Morning of the Magicians maintain\\r\\n that Hitler himself was clairvoyant and that he surrounded him-\\r\\n self with astrologers and prophets.  Eric Hanussen, a famous\\r\\n clairvoyant, was assassinated by the Nazis because his ability to\\r\\n \"see\" their secret projects was a threat t\" the regime. Today there\\r\\n are societies concerned with dowsins= and the use of the pendulum,\\r\\n metaphysical research, yoga, Spiritualism, psycho-physical investi-\\r\\n gation and psychical and spiritual studies.\\r\\n (Treece has a Society for the Scientific Research of Metaphysics,\\r\\n Rue %_athoupoleu: 10?1 Athens. and thy- PsvcL\\'r S,,ciety of Athens,\\r\\n 32  Tsiller-str.

Backster writes\\r\\n and lectures on his findings and set up (1965) a foundation to\\r\\n make further research possible. Other investigators and about 20\\r\\n universities are reported trying to replicate his work. Dr. Aristide\\r\\n Esser and Dr. Marcel Vogel report tentative corroboration of his\\r\\n findings.\\r\\n EDMA Corporation, a business enterprise organized by Edgar\\r\\n D.
