The bear would become the pet and mascot of the 22nd Artillery Supply Company of the Polish II Corps. The bear reportedly even fought alongside his fellow soldiers at the savage Battle of Monte Cassino in the spring of 1944, carrying heavy crates of mortar shells. With the approval of the Polish high command, the company's emblem was then changed to one showing a bear carrying a massive artillery shell.","icc:description":"Adobe RGB (1998)","icc:manufacturer":"Adobe RGB (1998)"},"url":"whaleoil.co.nz@@http://i2.wp.com/www.whaleoil.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Private-Voytek.jpg"}
