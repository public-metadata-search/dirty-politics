It first cost $2 at a junk shop in California. Now it's assessed at $5 million and is going on sale again: a photo of Wild West gunman Billy the Kid. It is said to be one of only two authenticated images of that iconic figure of frontier America. The tintype shot shows the outlaw -- real name William Henry McCarty -- pausing during a game of croquet in what is now New Mexico in 1878 with members of his gang, called the Lincoln County Regulators, and other people, said Kagin's, a firm that specializes in Western Americana and rare coins. The only other authenticated photo of Billy the Kid is a portrait of him taken in 1880. It sold in 2010 for $2.3 million, Kagin's said.
