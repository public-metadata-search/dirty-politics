The legs in the foreground were those of Michelle Korfman, who was one of the contestants. She disappeared right after this event and her skeletal remains were found a month later in the mountains near Los Angeles. His M.O. was to approach women wherever they congregated. He approached them in shopping malls, strip-malls, on the street in residential neighborhoods, and in one instance, at a Seventeen Magazine beauty pageant in Las Vegas, where he posed as a photographer.
