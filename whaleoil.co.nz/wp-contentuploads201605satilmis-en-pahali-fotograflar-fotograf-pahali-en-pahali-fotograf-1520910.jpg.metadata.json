In 1880, William H. Bonney...better known by his nickname Billy the Kid...posed for a travelling photographer in Fort Sumner, New Mexico. Roughly a year later, lawman Pat Garrett shot and killed the infamous outlaw, and later identified him in the picture, shown above, before publishing it in his book, a first-hand account titled The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid. The tintype remained in the possession of a single family for over 100 years. Although other pictures of him may exist, this has been the only recognized photograph of Billy the Kid with full provenance and authenticity for 130 years. In 2011 the tintype sold for $2.3 million to billionaire William Koch, making it one of the highest priced photos in history.
