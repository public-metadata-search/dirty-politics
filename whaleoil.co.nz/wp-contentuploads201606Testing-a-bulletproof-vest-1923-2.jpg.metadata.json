Photo: Shorpy.com..The gun players are WH Murphy and his assistant, of the Protective Garment Corporation of New York. The pictures were taken during a demonstration of the company...s ...bulletproof vest... for DC-area police in 1923. The live demonstration took place at the Washington city police headquarters. They are inventors and salesmen trying to convince the police force that these bulletproof vests work and save lives...The police officers in the background (on the second photo) are all part of the Frederick County Police Department, the gun they are firing is believed to be a S&W Model 10 Revolver. Mr. Murphy stood less than ten feet (3 meters) from the firing gun and took two consecutive .38 round slugs straight to the chest, and eye witnesses claims he ...didn...t bat an eye... in both cases. Later Murphy gave the deflected .38 bullet to the police officer as a souvenir. This vest weighed 11 lb (5.0 kg), fit close to the body, and was considered more comfortable than the previous types of bulletproof vests."]},"filename":"Testing-a-bulletproof-vest-1923-2.jpg","url":"whaleoil.co.nz@@http://www.whaleoil.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Testing-a-bulletproof-vest-1923-2.jpg"}
