Odile has put her hand on Marthe's shoulder. In 1941, Marthe Hoffnung, aged 21, enrolled in a nursing school affiliated with the Red Cross. She was the only Jewish student at the school, but her instructors assured her that she would not be discriminated against, as they vehemently rejected the Vichy-imposed anti-Jewish sanctions. Over the following year, Marthe became close friends with a fellow student, Odile de Morin."],"date":["2016-10-15T18:05:26","2016-10-15T19:12:01","2017-05-08T19:56:43"]},"filename":"12009_2.jpg","sha1":"38ae1b08cbb4b2f12bbbfbccd3e5ac7e05aa4fb1","filesize_bytes":829513,"url":"whaleoil.co.nz@@http://www.whaleoil.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/12009_2.jpg"}
