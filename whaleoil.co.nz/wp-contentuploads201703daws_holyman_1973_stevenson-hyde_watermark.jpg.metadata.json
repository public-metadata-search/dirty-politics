But he was a fellow invalid, terminally ill with tuberculosis, and felt a close affinity for the priest and his country despite their religious differences. Stevenson had travelled to Hawaii for his health in the summer of 1889 and visited the island of Molokai just after Damien...s death. Interviewing both Damien...s compatriots and Protestant critics, he found they ...build up the image of a man, with all his weaknesses, essentially heroic, and alive with rugged honesty, generosity, and mirth....6 Was he coarse? Dirty? Headstrong? Even bigoted? Stevenson admitted he probably was, but asserted that these faults didn...t diminish his bravery or achievements. To Stevenson, Damien...s failings simply made him a human, rather than superhuman, hero."],"tiff:PhotometricInterpretation":["2"],"tiff:SamplesPerPixel":["3"],"xap:CreatorTool":["Adobe Photoshop Elements 3.0 Windows"],"tiff:ImageWidth":["1470"],"icc:description":["Adobe RGB (1998)"],"xap:MetadataDate":["2017-03-20T11:35:02+12:00"],"exif:thumbnail:XResolution":["72/1"],"exif:thumbnail:ResolutionUnit":["2"],"exif:thumbnail:JPEGInterchangeFormat":["1198"]},"date":["2017-05-08 10:22:38","7032-02-01 00:00:00","2017-03-20 10:31:42","2017-03-20 11:35:02"]},"filesize_bytes":1440179,"url":"whaleoil.co.nz@@http://www.whaleoil.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/daws_holyman_1973_stevenson-hyde_watermark.jpg"}
