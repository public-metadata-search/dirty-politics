THESE in-yer-face polar bear pictures are the closest most of us get to one of natures most powerful predators. The heart-warming images show the curious white fur-balls as they investigate the camera held by one brave wildlife photographer  before they jump into the water with him to swim into his face. Other side-splitting shots show a male standing upright like a human with its arms outstretched, just like it was waving down a taxi. The incredible shots were taken by veteran nature photographer Steven Kazlowski, 43, from New York.   PHOTOGRAPH BY Stephen Kazlowski / Barcroft Media  UK Office, London.
