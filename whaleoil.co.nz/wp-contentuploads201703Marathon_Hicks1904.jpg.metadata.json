Ultimately, English-born Tom Hicks was named the winner. However, Hicks didn't have the exciting victory that one might dream of. Hicks had such a horrible race he never raced again after the event. Like the other runners, he was deeply affected by the heat and dust, but his two-man support team wouldn't give him any water. Instead, they gave him a shot of egg whites and strychnine, which was a popular performance supplement at the time."],"exif:thumbnail:YResolution":["72/1"],"icc:copyright":["Copyright (c) 1999 Adobe Systems Incorporated.
