Those who chose to stay were allowed to maintain the villages, with 16 of the original patients still living there. Thousands of graves mark the final resting places of most of the patients. In 1980, Kalaupapa National Historical Park was established to preserve the physical settings and structure of the settlement."],"exif:thumbnail:YResolution":["72/1"],"icc:copyright":["Copyright (c) 1999 Adobe Systems Incorporated.
