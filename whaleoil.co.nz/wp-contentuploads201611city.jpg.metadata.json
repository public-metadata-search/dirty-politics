Texas City experienced tremendous growth during the 1940s, largely due to the expansion of its chemical and petroleum industries during World War II. The 1940 census listed Texas City's population at 5,687, but by 1947 it had reached about 16,000. At that time, the city was home to two chemical plants, three large oil refineries, a tin smelter and oil tank farms. These industries offered plenty of jobs at relatively high wages, which attracted many new residents to the area."],"exif:thumbnail:XResolution":["72/1"],"tiff:PhotometricInterpretation":["1"],"xapMM:InstanceID":["xmp.iid:4317810AA54BE2118F33F7EB79CF9773"],"tiff:SamplesPerPixel":["4"],"xap:CreatorTool":["Adobe Photoshop Elements 3.0 Windows"],"tiff:ImageWidth":["930"],"xapMM:DocumentID":["xmp.did:4317810AA54BE2118F33F7EB79CF9773"],"crs:AlreadyApplied":["True"],"exif:thumbnail:ResolutionUnit":["2"],"exif:thumbnail:JPEGInterchangeFormat":["974"]},"date":["2017-05-08 11:12:48","2016-01-01 01:03:00","2012-12-21 13:48:31","2016-11-13 11:34:16"]},"filesize_bytes":250427,"url":"whaleoil.co.nz@@http://www.whaleoil.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/city.jpg"}
