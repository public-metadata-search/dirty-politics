The frontman was never married and he even hated the thought of living with a woman. He once said: \"If you move in with someone, you lose all respect for them. All them dirty knickers on the towel rail, all that snorting and farting. Does that appeal to you?

I never wanted the magic to stop.\" Brilliant."],"exif:thumbnail:YResolution":["72/1"],"icc:copyright":["Copyright (c) 1999 Adobe Systems Incorporated.
