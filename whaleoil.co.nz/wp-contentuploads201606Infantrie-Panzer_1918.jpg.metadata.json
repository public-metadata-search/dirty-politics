Body armor first came into being as a part of the warfare attire in the middle ages, when knights were required to wear heavy defensive gear. In addition to that, they would also carry a shield, which was akin to a protective screen or a barrier, which they could hold in front of themselves to ward off the incoming barrages of arrows, and strikes from swords, battle axes, maces or other weapons.When a 16th century European blacksmith finished making armour that could with-stain firearms, he fired a shot at the breastplate, denting it. As the story goes, this dent was proof to his customer that the armor would stand up to a bullet, so it became known as \"the bullet proof.\".He went around to police stations shooting himself in the chest to demonstrate its power.
