West Indians...half of whom were from Barbados...totaled 20 percent of the workforce, accounting for more than all the Americans and Europeans combined. The West Indians earned about ten cents an hour, had the most difficult working conditions, and had the worst food and housing of all the laborers. Still, some found a measure of success. \"Many returned home with the money they had earned during the construction period,\" adds Losch, \"but others established families and stayed on as employees of the Panama Canal.\" Here, according to the photo's notes, the S.S.
