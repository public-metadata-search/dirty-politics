He helped establish basic laws, improved a number of the island's structures, and constructed farms and schools. Although historians debate whether Damien's role was overemphasized in comparison to native workers, he is remembered as a pivotal figure in Hawaiian history. Damien contracted leprosy himself in 1884, and died in 1889. He was later recognized by the Kingdom of Hawaii with the Order of Kal..kaua, and in 2009 was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI as Saint Damien of Molokai."],"exif:thumbnail:YResolution":["72/1"],"icc:copyright":["Copyright (c) 1999 Adobe Systems Incorporated.
